# What is 'thmigpen'?
A Python 3.5 script to post notifications and public channel messages to pnut.io a week before a \#ThemeMonday event.

Though probably inelegant, intended initially to be run 1 to 3 times daily at times to suit Far Eastern, European and North American audiences.  It's important to note it'll only post on one day a month.
